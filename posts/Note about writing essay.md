As an Indie Hacker you will more likely to fail building multiple products, what you tend to keep is the knowledge and experience if what work what doesn't. And hopefully an audience that interest in what you have to say.

But audience does not come naturally, that why it's neccesary to write and share what you learn in public. The act of writing help you:
- [[Understand what you learned more deeply]]
- [[Help your future-self quickly re-learn your old lesson]] 
- Gain audience, through search engine, through backlink. This process usually take years, so the sooner you write and publish the better

## Collection of good writing tips
### Write like you speak

A few tips from [Paul Graham](https://web.getmatter.app/reader?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulgraham.com%2Ftalk.html&from=ext&v=3.0.1)

>Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you write: write in spoken language.

>So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask "Is this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?"

>After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.



### Practical advice from Niki
Ref: (https://wiki.nikiv.dev/writing/)

#### Saying more with less

==_Never use a long word where a short one will do._==

I try to have my writing be as transparent as possible for the person reading it. If something can be said simply, it is best to say it, simply.

#### Honesty

If I don't believe in what I am saying, it is waste of both mine and the person's reading my work time. If I believe in what idea or message or thought that it is I am trying to say, ==writing becomes second instinct and it is much easier to translate== what is in my head onto paper. Being honest with yourself may sometimes be difficult but [journaling](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/life/journaling) often helps in this regard.


 Framing:
    -   Presentation guides perception.
    -   You don't have to be an expert, just don't pretend to be.
    -   Topics are everywhere - just look at the problems you're solving every day.
    -   Share learnings & experiences instead of "selling" things. (Don't say `I hope I convinced you to use ..`. ==Just share what you want to share and let the readers decide for themselves.==)
