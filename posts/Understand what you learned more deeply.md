I always have the feeling that I understand some concept very well, but when I tried to explain it to someone, that feeling suddenly go away. It often mean, I don't understand it as deeply as I thought. 

By writing that down, I can visualize the gap in my understanding, and feel the gap with some more research or articulation.
